# Coded-TeraSort
Utilizing in-network coding to trade extra computations for more communication bandwidth in a distributed Sorting algorithm (TeraSort).  The project paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04850.

# Requirement
A local machine needs to have the following:
1. C/C++ compiler (g++)
2. OpenMPI library

# Usage
## Input file
A file containing data to be sorted must be placed in the `input` directory.  Note that the format of the data follows standard TeraSort input data.  Each record contains a 10-byte key and a 90-byte value.  An input file can be generated by TeraSort Example http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.8.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/examples/terasort/package-summary.html.

## TeraSort Configuration

Specify the number of nodes (K)


Run
